3D modeling is the process of creating a precise digital representation of an object’s geometry in three-dimensional space using specialized design software. The resulting output, known as a 3D model, mathematically defines the shape, structure, and dimensions of the object.

These models can be visualized as two-dimensional images through 3D rendering, analyzed in computer-based simulations of physical phenomena, or physically realized using 3D printing and fabrication techniques.

Models may be generated either manually, by designing and assembling geometric features, or automatically, through computational or scanning-based methods. In this project, manual 3D modeling is primarily used to develop accurate mechanical components and assemblies for the underwater vehicle, ensuring proper fit, structural integrity, and ease of manufacturing.
