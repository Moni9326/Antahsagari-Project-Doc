## What is ROS?

The **Robot Operating System (ROS)** is a flexible framework for writing robot software. ROS is a software suite that allows quick and easy development of autonomous robotic systems.

ROS should be considered as a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions for building new robotic solutions or modifying existing ones. One of the major advantages of ROS is its extensive ecosystem, which includes a wide range of drivers and pre-implemented algorithms widely used in robotics.
